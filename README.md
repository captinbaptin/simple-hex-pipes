# simple-hex-pipes
A game where you rotate tiles in a hexagonal grid to connect all the pipes.
There will always be at least 1 valid solution. There will never be any loops in a valid solution. This puzzle can be solved through logical deduction similarly to minesweeper.
This game is functional but lacking many features such as
   resizable board
   different board geometry (approximate square, looping edges, fun shapes)
   better color scheme

Controls:
  left click a tile to rotate it
  right click a tile to lock its rotation
  press 'n' to reset the game
